- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brystmar

I love exploring the intersection of food and tech!  I want people to fall in love with cooking, and to help them recognize that high-quality recipes don't necessarily need to be complicated, or require fancy ingredents/gadgets.  In fact, the fastest way to improve your results is to start with high-quality recipe sources like [America's Test Kitchen](https://americastestkitchen.com), or [Serious Eats](https://seriouseats.com).

My wife and I use the [Paprika](https://paprikaapp.com) recipe management app religiously.  Big fans!

My apps generally use Python backends and React + SASS for UI.  One of my [themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) is to share more, especially by contributing to open-source projects.  [Ping me](mailto:tp.berg+github.readme@gmail.com) if you think we should work together.
