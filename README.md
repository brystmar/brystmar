Hi, I‚Äôm Thomas üëã

I love exploring the intersection of food and tech!  In case you can't tell, I love food, and I want others to as well.

Many folks mistakenly think high-quality recipes require complexity, fancy ingredents, and/or crazy kitchen gadgets.  In fact, the easiest way to level-up your home cooking is by simply switching your everyday recipe resource to a site like [Serious Eats](https://seriouseats.com), or [America's Test Kitchen](https://americastestkitchen.com).  It's surprisingly easy to cook (and bake) food that's more delicious than anything on the menu of many local restaurants.

Side note: My wife and I use the [Paprika](https://paprikaapp.com) recipe management app religiously and are big fans ‚ù§ 

One of my [themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) is to share more, especially by contributing to open-source projects.  [Ping me](mailto:tp.berg+github.readme@gmail.com) if you think we should work together.

On the tech side, my apps generally use Python backends and React + SASS for UI.  Always open to learning new things!
